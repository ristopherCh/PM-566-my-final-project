This is my PM 566 Final Project website home. 

This project is an investigation into the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns contributed to the worstening of the substance abuse and drug overdose crisis in the United States during 2020 and 2021.
  
The website summarizing my findings is online here: https://ristopherch.github.io/PM-566-my-final-project/
